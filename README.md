# FullStack-Web-Example (WIP)
My first _full stack web project_, made in **Spring Tool Suite 4**. I'm working on it right now as a final project for a web development course. The objective is to create a functional web page that allows to add and remove books, with their authors and publishers, to an online bookstore stored in a SQL database.
